The purpose of this document is to provide information about how to process an EXIT for US employees.

> **Note:** EXITs must be processed within 3 business days per SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) standards.

The ticket will request that all access be removed for an employee

The “Service Request” should be auto generated based on the Employee EXIT Submittal Process documentation through TSM(HEAT).  As shown above, EXIT’s have their own section based on submittal.
